# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate my understanding and implimentation of JavaScript, JQuery, Moment.js, as well as Bootstrap. By utilizing "vanilla"JS as well as JQuery in tandem with Bootstrap, I was able to do more in less time and also allow the page to look better with less effort and time as in previous assignments. By pulling from 3rd party, I am able to broaden my coding capabilities and better the product/code I am putting out.
